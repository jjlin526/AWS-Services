* Deployed as a VM or specific hardware appliance (running Storage Gateway software onto your network)
* Integrates with S3 and EBS
* Supports three different gateway types:
    * Tape Gateway
    * Volume Gateway
    * File Gateway

* AWS Storage Gateway is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables on-premises applications to store and retrieve data from AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier. It provides a seamless integration between on-premises storage infrastructure and the cloud, allowing customers to use the cost and scalability benefits of the cloud while still maintaining control and access to their data on-premises. This service can be used in various scenarios such as backup and archive, disaster recovery, and file sharing.
