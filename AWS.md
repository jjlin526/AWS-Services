### AWS

* Collection of cloud computing services
* Can work together or independently
* Runs or supports a computer program
* Provides computing, routing, storage, networking, etc.
* AWS is a provider of Cloud Services

### Why depend on AWS?

* **Cost**: Without AWS, a user needs to buy a server to serve web application, a server for the database, cables to hook it up to a broadband connection and a dedicated room to house the hardware. On AWS, there are no upfront costs for most services.
* **Scalability**: Without AWS, a user must scale up by ordering another server. By deploying to AWS, scalability is resolved. Adding a server takes a few clicks - no upfront costs to spin up new instance of web application.
