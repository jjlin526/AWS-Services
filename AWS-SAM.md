### AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) 

AWS SAM is an open-source framework that can be used to build **serverless applications** on AWS.
  
A **serverless application** is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks.
* A serverless application is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings.
