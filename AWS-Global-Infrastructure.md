### AWS Regions 

* Each region is in a specific geographic location
* Each geographic location has a cluster of data centers

### Availability Zones

* Consists of one or more data centers
* Multiple availability zones are included with each AWS Region
* Located within the geographic area of the AWS Region
* Redundant power, networking and connectivity

### Availability

* Extent to which an application is fulfilling its intended business purpose. Applications that are highly-available are built in a manner where a single failure will not lessen the application's ability to be fully operational.

### Local Zones

* AWS Local Zones place computer, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users. Each AWS Local Zone location is an extension of an AWS Region. AWS Local Zones provide a high-bandwidth, secure connection between local workloads and those running in the AWS Region, allowing you to seamlessly connect to the full range of in-region services through the same API and tool sets.

### Wavelength Zones

Wavelength Zones are AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within communications service providers' (CSP) 5G networks, so application traffic from 5G devices reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the telecommunications network.
