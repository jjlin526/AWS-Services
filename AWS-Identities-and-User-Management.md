### Introduction to AWS IAM

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

* Service that controls access to AWS resources
* Using the service is free (for everyone who has an AWS account)
* Manages both authentication (what verifies users for us, enables them to login and manage credentials) and authorization (what the user can do; can access all actions on EC2 instances)
* Supports identity federation (use external identity provider to handle authentication of IAM) through Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) providers including Active Directory
