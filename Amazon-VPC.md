### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

* VPC enables AWS resources to be defined and launched in a **logically isolated virtual network**
* Amazon VPC gives you control over the virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security
* The VPC can be set up in the AWS service console
* Resources can be added to it (i.e. EC2 and RDS instances)
* Finally VPC communication with each other across accounts, Availability Zones, or AWS Regions should be defined
