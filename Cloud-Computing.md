### Traditional Data Centers

* Large up-front investment
* Forecasting demand is difficult
* Slow to deploy new data centers and servers
* Maintaining data centers is expensive
* You own all the security and compliance burden

### Benefits of cloud computing

* Trade capital expense for variable expenses
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Stop guessing capacity (grow/shrink based on demand)
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money maintaining data centers
* Go global in minutes

### Elasticity

* Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

### Reliability

* A solution's ability to provide functionality for its users when it is needed. Amazon's global infrastructure is built to maximize reliability for your cloud workloads.

### Agility

* The cloud lowers the cost of trying new ideas or business processes
* Reduces the time required to maintain infrastructure
* Reduces risk for the organization around security and compliance
* Provides access to emerging technologies

### Cloud Computing

* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

### Cloud Computing Scenarios

1. Roger's company runs several production workloads in its data center. They are using VMWare to manage infrastructure (virtual servers) in their data center. They want to use AWS and integrate it with their data center for new workloads. Which cloud deployment model would his company be following?

* **Hybrid cloud** (both private cloud in own data center and public cloud: AWS)

2. Eliza's company is trying to decide whether to fund a new line of business. Eliza's team is looking to monetize a new emerging technology. This new line of business will require new infrastructure. What benefit of cloud computing would be most relevant to her company?

* **Pay as you go** (transitioning from large up-front investment to variable cost - can try out emerging technology at small scale and only for what they are using)

3. Jennifer is the CTO at an insurance company. They are considering moving to the cloud instead of colocating servers. They want to make sure they have maximum control of the cloud servers. Which cloud computing model would they need to leverage?

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** (want to have maximum control, and for security/compliance given that they are an insurance company -- not PaaS or Saas)
