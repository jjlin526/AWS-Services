### Traditional Data Centers

* Large up-front investment
* Forecasting demand is difficult
* Slow to deploy new data centers and servers
* Maintaining data centers is expensive
* You own all the security and compliance burden

### Benefits of cloud computing

* Trade capital expense for variable expenses
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Stop guessing capacity (grow/shrink based on demand)
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money maintaining data centers
* Go global in minutes

### Elasticity

* Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

### Reliability

* A solution's ability to provide functionality for its users when it is needed. Amazon's global infrastructure is built to maximize reliability for your cloud workloads.

### Agility

* The cloud lowers the cost of trying new ideas or business processes
* Reduces the time required to maintain infrastructure
* Reduces risk for the organization around security and compliance
* Provides access to emerging technologies

### Cloud Computing

* Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
