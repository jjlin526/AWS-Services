### Traditional Data Centers

* Large up-front investment
* Forecasting demand is difficult
* Slow to deploy new data centers and servers
* Maintaining data centers is expensive
* You own all the security and compliance burden

### Benefits of cloud computing

* Trade capital expense for variable expenses
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Stop guessing capacity (grow/shrink based on demand)
* Increase speed and agility
* Stop spending money maintaining data centers
* Go global in minutes

### Elasticity

* Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.
