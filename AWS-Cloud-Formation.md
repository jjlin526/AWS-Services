### AWS CloudFormation

* AWS CloudFormation speeds up **cloud provisioning with infrastructure as code (IaC)**
* AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS 
* You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you
* You do not need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what is dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that

### What is Infrastructure as Code (IAC)?

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through **code instead of through manual processes**. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

AWS CloudFormation enables a user to model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.
