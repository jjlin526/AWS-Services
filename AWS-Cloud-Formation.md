### AWS CloudFormation

* AWS CloudFormation speeds up **cloud provisioning with infrastructure as code (IaC)**

### What is Infrastructure as Code (IAC)?

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through **code instead of through manual processes**. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

AWS CloudFormation enables a user to model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.
